What this file does:

1. Reads GGADT output files and puts all of it floato a FITS file of the same format as ScatteringModel
2. Creates a ggadt version of the ScatteringModel class that can be initialized with a FITS file

    Requires: filename must be a valid filename from the ggadt astrodust model
    Purpose: parse_file takes in a ggadt total cross section output file and returns a dict
    NOTE: The header of the ggadt output files are lines 1 - 23 (0 - 22 for 0-indexing), lines 24 (23) - inf are data

    #Read the file line by line (so we have data for each energy) then put each variable floato their own respective arrays

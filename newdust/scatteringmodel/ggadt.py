'''
What this file does:

1. Reads GGADT output files and puts all of it floato a FITS file of the same format as ScatteringModel
2. Creates a ggadt version of the ScatteringModel class that can be initialized with a FITS file

'''
    Purpose: make_fits will make a fits file for a given material given its ggadt output files

    Parameters should be a binary table HDU (energy is a parameter! -- it's the same for every grain)
    qsca, qext, and qabs should be image tables

    Uses the parse_file, make_header, and make_pars helpers

    naming convention for files:

    [material name]_[radius index (starting at 1)]_[rand or set (set is only for i > 10)].out

    there are 54 files per material i goes from 1-32 inclusive (from 11 - 32 there are two files per index)

    ex: hematite_8_rand.out or metallic_iron_32_set.out

    The last step is to go through every file for the given material and add their specific parameters, and extinction values to an imageHDU

    The header of this will contain the radius, orientation (true = oriented), shape, and the order of q_ext, q_abs, and q_sca
